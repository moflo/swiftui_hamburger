### Description
Create two sub-views which, critially, need to be cast to AnyView() structs
Pages View then dynamically presents the subviews, based on currentPage state
BurgerMenuView then wraps the pages with a dynamic menu and binds the isShowing and currentPage states


### TODO

1. Refactor into a Swift Package
2. Add dynamic list of menu items, likely as a `stuct` input type
